[Project 1: Analysis of causes of corruption]

This is a homework assignment for my undergraduate International Studies: Global Economics degree.
Contains two files:

[GDPCorruptionData.xlsx] The first 5 sheets contain regression results from multiple variables in the "data" sheet. 
The "data" sheet contains development indicators for 159 countries and scatterplots comparing different variables.
                         
                         
[GDPCorruptionReport.docx] A written report exploring Human Development Index as an instrumental variable in the correlation between GDP and Corruption. 

This project introduced the concept of instrumental variables in statistics and how they can be used alongside regression analysis to find causality between variables.


[Project 2: Data Visualizations]

This is a homework assignment for my Public Policy undergraduate certificate. The pdf [DataVisualizations.pdf] contains two data visualizations created in Tableau. The first visualization accurately portrays the data while the second is intentionally misleading and less relevant to the intended audience.


[Project 3: Conditional Convergence and Total Factor Productivity Growth]
This is an assignment for my undergraduate International Studies: Global Economics degree. 
Contains two files:

[CCandTFPGdata.xlsx] Contains the data set along with the statistical calculations and charts created for the written assignment.

[CCandTFPGreport.pdf] Contains 2 questions and my responses. The first question explores the economic theory of Conditional Convergence by measuring GDP growth among countries that have similar education and infant mortality rates. The second question explores Total Factor Productivity through histograms and T-tests to measure differences in TFP growth among different geographical regions along with differences in which factors of production have seen the most growth.
