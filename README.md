#[Project 1: Analysis of causes of corruption]

This is a homework assignment for my undergraduate International Studies: Global Economics degree.
Contains two files:
-[GDPCorruptionData.xlsx] The first 5 sheets contain regression results from multiple variables in the "data" sheet. 
                          The "data" sheet contains development indicators for 159 countries and scatterplots comparing different variables.
-[GDPCorruptionReport.docx] A written report exploring Human Development Index as an instrumental variable in the correlation between GDP and Corruption. 
This project introduced the concept of instrumental variables in statistics and how they can be used alongside regression analysis to find causality between variables.
